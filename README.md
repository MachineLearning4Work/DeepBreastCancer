Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification: A Deep Learning Approach

Breast cancer remains the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-induced mortality
among women with 2.4 million new cases diagnosed and 523, 000 deaths per year. Historically, a diagnosis has been
initially performed using clinical screening followed by histopathological analysis. Automated classification of cancers
using histopathological images is a challenging task of accurate detection of tumor sub-types. This process could be facilitated by machine learning approaches, which may be more reliable and economical compared to conventional method
